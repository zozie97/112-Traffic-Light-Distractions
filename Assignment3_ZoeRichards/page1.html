			<h2> WHAT WE DO... </h2>
				<br><br>
					<p>  

						This website is based off of my interactions that I observed around wellington central. The main interaction that I observed was crossing the road and how long it takes for pedestrian lights to let people cross the road. My idea is to help make this interaction a little easier and to help brighten a person's day. 
						<br><br><br>
						What I decided on was to make an interactive webpage that had two "distractions" one that is a picture drawer and one that is a poem. I decided to make "distractions" to help people pass the long times they have to wait at pedestrian crossings. The abstract picture drawer draws ellipses of different sizes and colours at the point where your mouse is, so you do not have to click, only drag for it to draw the ellipses.
						<br><br><br>
						Enjoy!

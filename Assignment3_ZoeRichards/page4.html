				<h2> Distraction 2 - Poetry </h2>
				<h3>Pain Ends by Katy A. Brown </h3>
					
					<div id="columnPoem" >

						<p id="poem">
							Breathe in the fresh air, 
							<br>
							Put your mind at ease.
							<br> 
							Let down your hair,
							<br>
							Let it flow in the breeze. 
							<br><br>

							Let your eyes wander
							<br>
							To all the beauty to be seen.
							<br> 
							If those toxic thoughts you still do ponder,
							<br>
							Then let out a scream. 
							<br><br>

							Scream until the pain is gone,
							<br>
							Until you're no longer feel afraid. 
							<br>
							Open your eyes to a new dawn,
							<br>
							Let the darkness fade. 
							<br><br>

							No longer compare yourself
							<br>
							Or your flaws to others' perfections. 
							<br>
							Take the negativity off the shelf,
							<br>
							Focus on your direction. 
						</p>

				<p id = "poem">
						Pick the sadness up off the floor,
						<br>
						Sweep it into the wind.
						<br> 
						Close the door on self-hatred,
						<br>
						Never let it back in. 
						<br><br>

						For the lies it would often tell you,
						<br>
						You will no longer agree. 
						<br>
						Happiness and love are what you should hold onto,
						<br>
						They are whom you should give the key. 
						<br><br>

						Pay no attention to the toxic thoughts,
						<br>
						Listen to those who adore everything you are. 
						<br>
						Overthinking was what you once were taught, 
						<br>
						But now those thoughts you put in a jar. 
						<br><br>

						Focus on your goals,
						<br>
						Never lose your fight. 
						<br>
						It's time to open new scrolls,
						<br>
						Everything will be all right.
